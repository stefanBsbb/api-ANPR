Node Express API
This is a Node.js Express API for managing vehicle and device data. The API generates vehicle data and stores it in a database, while fetching available locations from devices. It also ensures that only devices with an active status are used when generating vehicle data. The API is secured with environment variables, with sensitive information excluded from version control.
